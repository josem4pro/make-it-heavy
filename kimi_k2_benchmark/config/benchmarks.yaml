      Three friends (Alice, Bob, Charlie) are comparing their ages:
      - Alice is twice as old as Bob was when Alice was as old as Bob is now
      - Bob is 20 years old
      - Charlie is as old as Alice and Bob together
      What is Charlie's age?

      Optimize the following Python function that finds all pairs in a list that sum to a target value.
      Current implementation is O(n²). Make it O(n).

      ```python
      def find_pairs(arr, target):
          pairs = []
          for i in range(len(arr)):
              for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
                  if arr[i] + arr[j] == target:
                      pairs.append((arr[i], arr[j]))
          return pairs
      ```

      Provide the optimized code with explanation.

      Refactor this code to fix code smells and improve maintainability:

      ```python
      class DataProcessor:
          def processData(self, d):
              r = []
              for i in d:
                  if i > 0:
                      if i < 100:
                          x = i * 2
                          if x % 3 == 0:
                              r.append(x)
                          else:

                      pass

      Design a distributed rate limiting system that must satisfy these constraints:
      1. Support 100,000 requests per second across multiple servers
      2. Allow configurable limits per user (requests/minute)
      3. Provide < 10ms latency for limit checks
      4. Handle server failures gracefully
      5. Support both hard and soft limits

      Describe the architecture, data structures, algorithms, and trade-offs in your design.
